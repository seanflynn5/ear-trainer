# My Ear Trainer

Built to help musicians enhance aural skills. Among "Chord Types", select the kinds of chords you want to practice hearing. Once you 'Play' a chord, you can make your selection under 'Your Answer' to see if you chose correctly or repeat the current chord for more reinforcement. A score keeps a tally of how many chords you choose correctly in a row. Happy listening!
